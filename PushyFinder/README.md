# PushyFinder for FINAL FANTASY XIV
A Dalamud plugin to ping your phone via [Pushover](https://pushover.net) whenever a Party Finder event or duty pop happens with an AFK client.

## Usage
Install the plugin, configure it using `/pushyfinder`, go AFK (look for the red icon) and enjoy.

You will need a valid [Pushover](https://pushover.net) license, application key and user key to use this.
Support for other push notification services is coming soon, but for now, evaluate for yourself whether a one-time $5 purchase is worth it. We think it is.
